# FirstTeamAPP

Short description or overview of your application.

## Introduction

This application is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy and is designed for newcomers who are looking for their first job
and may have little to no prior work experience.

It provides a platform where job seekers with limited experience can create profiles, showcase their skills, and connect
with employers or teams interested in hiring individuals who are just starting their careers. The application offers job
listings, opportunities for candidates to apply, and a way for employers to browse and reach out to potential
candidates.

Whether you are a recent graduate, a career changer, or someone entering the workforce for the first time, this
application aims to make the job search process more accessible and tailored to individuals at the beginning of their
professional journey.
